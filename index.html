                <div class="story__content">
                    <p>It began—like all great modern romances—with a pandemic Zoom happy hour and a shared sense of mischief. 💻🍷</p>
                    
                    <p>Emily was a Minnesota girl at heart, temporarily living out of a suitcase and wondering how life had landed her in an unexpected corner of the country. Sean had been rooted in Los Angeles for over a decade, writing books, sipping tea, and somehow making dry wit feel like a warm hug. What started as online hangouts quickly turned into in-person chemistry—and before long, things got wonderfully real. ✈️❤️</p>

                    <p>For the next couple of years, Emily crisscrossed the country for months at a time, balancing airports, work, parenting, and knitting needles with only mild turbulence. Eventually, love (and logistics) brought her to LA—for good.</p>
                    
                    <p>From the very beginning, Fiona—Sean's daughter and our in-house matchmaker—seemed to know where this was going. On our very first day hanging out together, she grabbed each of our hands and kept trying to put them together. 👧🏽💞🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 She was right, of course.</p>

                    <p>Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook wasn't just a pretty backdrop. 🌄 It was the place where, early in their story, Sean realized something quietly enormous: he didn't just want to keep talking to Emily—he wanted to kiss her. 😘 Later, when she came back to LA as his girlfriend, they returned to that same spot and kissed properly, with all the clarity that comes from being on the same page.</p>

                    <p>So when they planned to take some family photos there with Fiona, Emily already had a hunch. The box, the setting, the timing—it all lined up. 🗃️🕰️ Sean, to his credit, still gave it his all: one knee, one ring, and one very proud kid standing between them, grinning like the mastermind she is. 👧🏽💍🦊</p>
