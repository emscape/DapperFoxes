## 📖 Our Story

It began—like all great modern romances—with a pandemic Zoom happy hour and a shared sense of mischief. 💻🍷

Emily was a Minnesota girl at heart, temporarily living out of a suitcase and wondering how life had landed her in an unexpected corner of the country. Sean had been rooted in Los Angeles for over a decade, writing books, sipping tea, and somehow making dry wit feel like a warm hug. What started as online hangouts quickly turned into in-person chemistry—and before long, things got wonderfully real. ✈️❤️

For the next couple of years, Emily crisscrossed the country for months at a time, balancing airports, work, parenting, and knitting needles with only mild turbulence. Eventually, love (and logistics) brought her to LA—for good.

From the very beginning, Fiona—Sean’s daughter and our in-house matchmaker—seemed to know where this was going. On our very first day hanging out together, she grabbed each of our hands and kept trying to put them together. 👧🏽💞🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 She was right, of course.

Now, we're writing a new chapter as a family—full of laughter, learning, co-parenting, creativity, and the kind of love that makes even time zones feel temporary. 🕰️💫
