## 💍 She Knew. He Kneeled. Fiona Approved.

Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook wasn’t just a pretty backdrop. 🌄 It was the place where, early in their story, Sean realized something quietly enormous: he didn’t just want to keep talking to Emily—he wanted to kiss her. 😘 Later, when she came back to LA as his girlfriend, they returned to that same spot and kissed properly, with all the clarity that comes from being on the same page.

So when they planned to take some family photos there with Fiona, Emily already had a hunch. The box, the setting, the timing—it all lined up. 🗃️🕰️ Sean, to his credit, still gave it his all: one knee, one ring, and one very proud kid standing between them, grinning like the mastermind she is. 👧🏽💍🦊

Fiona was the only one truly surprised—which is poetic, considering she tried to make them hold hands the very first day they met. 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽❤️

No flash mobs. No skywriting. Just a quiet, perfect moment in a place that already meant everything, shared by the people who made it unforgettable. ✨
